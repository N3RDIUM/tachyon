Self-hosting Tachyon is easy. Grab the latest release from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/weebney/tachyon/tree/main/tachyon) (it's recommended you use `tachyon.min.js`) and upload it to your server. Link the script somewhere in your HTML with `<script src="..." defer>` and you're good to go!

⚠ Please keep in mind that your `<script>` tag ***MUST INCLUDE*** `defer`.
