This means that when the user clicks on the link, the page is already downloaded and ready to be displayed. This results in a significantly faster page load time.</p><p>Tachyon works on mobile devices as well by checking for a tap event instead of a hover event.</p><p>Tachyon&rsquo;s is free-and-open-source software (source available on <a href=https://github.com/weebney/tachyon target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub</a>), licensed under the <a href=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weebney/tachyon/main/LICENSE target=_blank rel=noopener>MIT License</a>.</p><h2 id=technical-details>Technical Details</h2><h3 id=security>Security</h3><p>Tachyon is completely safe to use on your website. It does not contain any tracking, analytics, or other malicious code- it&rsquo;s <a href=https://github.com/weebney/tachyon target=_blank rel=noopener>completely open-source</a> and plenty of sites trust Tachyon in production right now.</p><p>Tachyon leverages <a href=https://unpkg.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>unpkg</a>, a CDN that is trusted by many popular websites and powered by <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Cloudflare</a>.</p><p>Subresource integrity is used to ensure that the script delivered to your users&rsquo; browsers hasn&rsquo;t been tampered with.</p><p>The npm package (which is unpkg&rsquo;s source for Tachyon) is exclusively published from one machine behind a wireguard bastion; the subresource integrity hash and minified script are computed locally and updated on the dev branch of the <a href=https://github.com/weebney/tachyon target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub repository</a> ahead of new versions being published to npm. All official Tachyon pages, this website and the GitHub repository, are hosted by GitHub.</p><h3 id=default-behavior>Default Behavior</h3><p><strong>By default, Tachyon will run on all <code>&lt;a href="..."></code> tags.</strong> When an end-user hovers their cursor over a link for more than 50ms, Tachyon will generate a <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch" href="..."></code> tag for the anchor&rsquo;s <code>href="..."</code> attribute. This will cause the browser to begin downloading the page content of <code>href="..."</code> in the background, so when the user clicks through the link, the page is already being downloaded and ready to begin loading into frame.</p><p>When a user unhovers their cursor from a link, Tachyon will remove the <code>&lt;link rel="prefetch" href="..."></code> tag, canceling the download. This is done to prevent the browser from downloading content that the user may not click on and to avoid wasting bandwidth.</p><p>These prefetch requests are given <a href=https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf target=_blank rel=noopener>extremely low priority</a>; they will not interfere with the speed of other requests.</p><h3 id=tachyon--alternatives>Tachyon & Alternatives</h3><p>Tachyon could be considered an alternative to projects like <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20221110043446/https://instant.page/ target=_blank rel=noopener>instant.page</a> or <a href=https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink target=_blank rel=noopener>quicklink</a> which offer a similar feature set. That being said, Tachyon has some serious advantages compared to other similar projects.</p><p>Put simply, <strong>Tachyon improves a website&rsquo;s speed significantly more than instant.page</strong>, uses <strong>significantly less bandwidth</strong>, and is <strong>4.08x smaller</strong>.</p><p>Tachyon is simpler, more flexible, and better thought at its core out than any other alternative. It&rsquo;s the best option in virtually all use cases where something like instant.page or quicklink could be used.</p><p>For one, Tachyon implements the prefetching behavior in a way that is <strong>significantly</strong> more efficient and less intrusive than other projects- it only preloads pages that are likely to be clicked, and it stops prefetching pages when the user&rsquo;s cursor leaves the link. This means that Tachyon will not waste bandwidth on pages that the user may not click on, and it will not add nearly as large of a load to your server as alternatives.</p><p>Alternatives include a ridiculous amount of code for the extremely simple core functionality that prefetching scripts offer. Tachyon is <a href=#tachyons-philosophy>built with simplicity at its core</a>, and it allows everyone to reap the massive benefits in performance, extensibility, maintainability, security, and ease of use.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not like Tachyon offers less features than other projects, either- it&rsquo;s just that Tachyon&rsquo;s features are implemented in a way that is more efficient from a code perspective than other projects. It supports mobile with no configuration, implements <a href=#whitelist>whitelisting</a>, <a href=#blacklist>blacklisting</a>, <a href=#custom-timing>custom timing</a>, and <a href=#same-origin-only>same origin restriction</a> in a way that is much more efficient than other projects, and it makes these features arguably easier to use. If you need some hyper-specific feature, Tachyon may not be the best option for you- for everyone else, Tachyon is undoubtedly the best option.</p><h3 id=tachyons-philosophy>Tachyon&rsquo;s Philosophy</h3><p>The web is extremely bloated. In a perfect world, we would all do our part to fix this- I personally try to build things as leanly as possible, but unfortunately the addiction of the web to bloat has only continued growing. As a consultant, I&rsquo;ve seen first-hand how this bloat negatively impacts the user experience and conversion rates of websites. As much as I wish it were true, I don&rsquo;t have the time, resources, or bargaining power to have my clients completely re-engineer their websites. For this reason I created a script to function as a quick-and-easy patch for the bloat problem to simplify my job of delivering on growth goals for clients; Tachyon is my attempt to fix not the bloat problem, but the key symptom of the bloat problem: slow websites.</p><p>As I have taken this concept and fleshed it out for public use, I have focused on simplicity in two areas:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Tachyon should be simple to use by everyone.</strong>
I want to make it as easy as possible for anyone, regardless of their technical prowess, to use Tachyon; everything from how Tachyon&rsquo;s features are implemented to how this website documents Tachyon&rsquo;s usage should be as easy to utilize as possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tachyon&rsquo;s codebase should be as simple as possible.</strong>
Simplicity is baked into Tachyon&rsquo;s design. Any person with a basic understanding of JavaScript should be able to understand Tachyon&rsquo;s codebase in a matter of minutes. This simplicity serves multiple functions: it makes Tachyon highly performant, easy to use, easy to maintain and extend by both myself and other developers, and it makes Tachyon extremely easy to audit and verify that it is safe to use on your website.</p></li></ul><h3 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p>Tachyon gets some fair questions from time to time, mostly due to misunderstanding Tachyon&rsquo;s purpose and functionality.</p><ul><li><strong>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t this encourage people to continue building bloated websites?&rdquo;</strong></li></ul><p>In general, the developers currently working on any given website aren&rsquo;t really responsible for the majority of the bloat simply due to the fact that they likely didn&rsquo;t build it or just have better things to work on. Technical debt is an inevitable product of any piece of software&rsquo;s history, and the developers working on it are often just trying to keep the site running. I built Tachyon first-and-foremost for myself; my job as a consultant is to help a client get the most out what they have as quickly as possible without burdening their internal teams, and Tachyon is a tool that helps me do that. It&rsquo;s not a magic bullet that will fix all of their problems, but it&rsquo;s a tool that can help them get more out of their existing website without spending precious time trying to undo years of spaghetti code or migrate to some slick new technology.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re building a new website, you should absolutely be building it as leanly as possible. If you&rsquo;re working on an existing website, you should absolutely be working to reduce its bloat. When neither of those are viable, i.e. a lot of the time, Tachyon is here for you.</p><ul><li><strong>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t prefetching content like this a privacy risk for end-users?&rdquo;</strong></li></ul><p>Prefetching doesn&rsquo;t expose an end user to code execution (including tracking), as code isn&rsquo;t even downloaded until the user navigates to the page. The only risk is that the user&rsquo;s browser will download content that they don&rsquo;t end up using, but this is a risk that is inherent to the web and is not unique to Tachyon. In the exceptionally rare case that a user&rsquo;s threat model includes third-parties linked to by websites they use, it&rsquo;s their own responsibility to modify their browser for privacy; they will usually have already disabled prefetching in their browser whether they know it or not because many privacy extensions and privacy focused browsers do this by default.</p><h2 id=advanced-configuration>Advanced Configuration</h2><p>Tachyon allows you to fine tune the script to your site&rsquo;s needs with a few simple properties. The vast majority of Tachyon users will not need to change these, but they are available for those who wish to do so.</p><p>Tachyon&rsquo;s configuration features are toggled on with <code>data-tachyon-*</code> attributes.</p><h4 id=custom-timing>Custom Timing</h4><p>If you&rsquo;re able to determine that the 50ms default timing is not optimal for your site, you can change it by adding the <code>data-tachyon-timer</code> attribute to website&rsquo;s <code>&lt;body></code> tag. This attribute takes an integer (in milliseconds) that will alter the script&rsquo;s behavior as such, i.e. if you want to set the timing to 100ms, your body tag will look like <code>&lt;body </code><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy"><code>data-tachyon-timer="100"</code></span><code>></code></p><h4 id=same-origin-only>Same-Origin Only</h4><p>By default, Tachyon will prefetch content from any domain. If you want Tachyon to only prefetch content from the same domain, you can add <code>data-tachyon-same-origin</code> to the <code>&lt;body></code> tag. A full implementation of this would look like <code>&lt;body </code><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy"><code>data-tachyon-same-origin</code></span><code>></code>.</p><h4 id=blacklist>Blacklist</h4><p>If you want Tachyon to ignore certain links, add <code>data-tachyon</code> to the <code>&lt;a></code> tag. The blacklist is the default behavior of Tachyon, so you don&rsquo;t need to do anything to enable it, just flag the <code>&lt;a></code> tag with the <code>data-tachyon</code> attribute.</p><p>In the following example the first <code>&lt;a></code> tag will be ignored by Tachyon and will not be prefetched, but the second <code>&lt;a></code> tag will be prefetched as it does not have the <code>data-tachyon</code> attribute and is therefore not on the blacklist.</p><p><code>&lt;body></code></p><p><code>&lt;a href="https://example.com" </code><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy"><code>data-tachyon</code></span><code>>Blacklisted!&lt;/a></code></p><p><code>&lt;a href="https://example.com">I'll prefetch!&lt;/a></code></p><p><code>&lt;/body></code></p><h4 id=whitelist>Whitelist</h4><p>To enable whitelist mode, add <code>data-tachyon-whitelist</code> to the page&rsquo;s <code>&lt;body></code> tag. Tachyon&rsquo;s whitelist works in the exact opposite way of the blacklist. In whitelist mode, Tachyon will <strong>only</strong> run on <code>&lt;a></code> tags that have the <code>data-tachyon</code> attribute.</p><p>In the following example the second <code>&lt;a></code> tag will be ignored by Tachyon and will not be prefetched, but the first <code>&lt;a></code> tag will be prefetched as it has the <code>data-tachyon</code> attribute and is therefore on the whitelist.</p><p><code>&lt;body </code><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy"><code>data-tachyon-whitelist</code></span><code>></code></p><p><code>&lt;a href="https://example.com" </code><span style="text-decoration:underline wavy"><code>data-tachyon</code></span><code>>I'll prefetch!&lt;/a></code></p><p><code>&lt;a href="https://example.com">Not on the list! Won't prefetch!&lt;/a></code></p><p><code>&lt;/body></code></p><h2 id=known-issues>Known Issues</h2><p>Many privacy and ad-blocking extensions disable the functionality that Tachyon relies on. Please keep this in mind as you test your site&rsquo;s implementation of the script.</p><h4 id=single-page-applications>Single Page Applications</h4><p>Tachyon does not work with single page applications/client-side routing. It shouldn&rsquo;t break anything, but it won&rsquo;t do anything either- this is because Tachyon relies on native prefetching functionality, which doesn&rsquo;t work with single page applications because client side routers hijack <code>&lt;a></code> tags.</p><h4 id=firefox-support>Firefox Support</h4><p>Prefetching is supported but incorrectly implemented in Firefox- it will only work as intended if the prefetched page is fully downloaded and cached. This is a known issue (and has been for years) that will likely be fixed in a future release of Firefox; the issue had its severity updated as recently as October 2022.</p><h4 id=safari-support>Safari Support</h4><p>Prefetching is currently disabled by default on both desktop and mobile versions of Safari. It is unclear if this behavior will change in the future.</p><h4 id=-tachyon-is-in-active-development>‚ö† Tachyon is in active development.</h4><p>Please report any bugs or issues you come across in the <a href=https://github.com/weebney/tachyon/issues target=_blank rel=noopener>issue tracker</a> of the <a href=https://github.com/weebney/tachyon/ target=_blank rel=noopener>GitHub repository</a>.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Zuzana Padychova.
