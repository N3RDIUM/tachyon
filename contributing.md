# Contributing

Tachyon subscribes to the following philosophy:

- If this project is not helping you, then there is a bug
- If you are having a bad time using this project, then there is a bug
- If the documentation is confusing, then the documentation is buggy
- If there is a bug in this project, then we can work together to fix it.

There is a [list of known issues](https://fasterthanlight.net/#known-issues) on the websiteâ€”if anything else comes up, though, please do [open an issue](https://github.com/weebney/tachyon/issues/) in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/weebney/tachyon/issues/) or open a pull request.

Tachyon has only a few code contribution rules to keep the project's codebase growing at a sustainable rate:

- Please squash your commits before submitting a pull request.
- Large pull requests should be split into multiple smaller pull requests where possible.
